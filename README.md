# GTreasury NPV Calculator – Coding Project

Welcome! This repository contains my submission for GTreasury’s coding assessment, where I implemented an API-first solution to calculate Net Present Value (NPV) across a dynamic range of discount rates.

## Project Highlights

This project demonstrates practical experience in:

- Building scalable backend services using **ASP.NET Core**
- Designing a responsive **Single Page Application (SPA)** with interactive charts
- Applying **SOLID principles** for clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Creating a modular codebase with **unit-tested business logic**
- Leveraging **asynchronous programming** for smooth frontend-backend communication

## Features

- RESTful API to process cash flow data and calculate NPV values
- Frontend SPA with real-time visualization of NPV results
- Manual NPV calculations **without financial libraries**
- Input validation and clean user experience
- Extensible design ready for caching, pagination, or enhancements

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, C#, xUnit  
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Chart.js  
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (Frontend), Render (Backend)
